# Hill and Valley Prediction with Logistic Regression


Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using logistic regression that can accurately classify geographical locations as either hills or valleys based on a given set of features.

Data Source
The dataset is from YBI Foundation.

Features
Uses a dataset with 100 input features representing different environmental/geographical variables.

Logistic Regression is used as the main classifier.

Data preprocessing includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Project Workflow
Import Libraries:
Essential libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.) are imported.

Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Dataset is loaded from the YBI Foundationâ€™s GitHub.

Cleaning steps: removing nulls, outliers, and encoding necessary columns.

Feature Selection:

Defines feature variables 
X
X and target 
y
y.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

Model Training:

Trains Logistic Regression model with the training data.

Prediction & Evaluation:

Predicts classification (hill/valley) on the test set.

Evaluates model accuracy and suitability for new data.

Visualization:

Visualizes prediction results and data distributions using matplotlib.

Results
The model predicts if a geographical location represents a hill or valley, achieving balanced performance as per the dataset.

How to Run
Clone the repository and open AvinashReddyproject.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab).

Install dependencies (if not already installed):

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the results.

Future Work
Explore other classification algorithms.

Improve feature engineering and data visualization.

Deploy as a web app or API.
